Use free publically accessible sources to gather SSL information ðŸ’ª 

`crtsh_query.py` - python script that per domain extracts the most recent SSL certificate data - issuer_name, serial_number, not_before (expiry date) and not_after (begin date) - from crt.sh and outputs results to a csv file. Simply create a `domains.txt` file, populate it with the domains you want to query, and then run the script!
